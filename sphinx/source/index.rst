If you found a bug or mistake in this project, I would like to know about it.
Before you send me the bug report though, please check the following:

1. Are you using the latest version? The bug you found may already have been
   fixed.
2. Check that your input is in the correct format and you have selected the
   correct options.
3. Please reduce your input to the smallest possible size that still produces
   the bug; I will need your input data to reproduce the problem, and the
   smaller you can make it, the easier it will be for both of us.
