========================
Importing Pyokit modules
========================
The library is divided into five sub-modules: datastruct, mapping, sequencing
testing, and util. After installing the libraries, they can be used either
from the interactive python prompt or in scripts. To use, for example, the
IntervalTree class which is in the intervalTree module in the datastruct
package, type (either in the python interpretor or your script):


>>> from pyokit.datastruct.intervalTree import IntervalTree
